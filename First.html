		Early beginnings
Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto :

A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.[3]

After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap and released as an open-source project on August 19, 2011.[4] It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, a small group of core developers, and a large community of contributors.[5]

Bootstrap 2
On January 31, 2012, Bootstrap 2 was released, which added built-in support for Glyphicons, several new components, as well as changes to many of the existing components. This version supports responsive web design, meaning the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically, taking into account the characteristics of the device used (whether desktop, tablet, mobile phone).[6]

Bootstrap 3
On August 19, 2013, Bootstrap 3, was released. It redesigned components to use flat design and a mobile first approach. Bootstrap 3 features new plugin system with namespaced events. Bootstrap 3 dropped Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 3.6 support, but there is an optional polyfill for these browsers.[7]

Bootstrap 4
Mark Otto announced Bootstrap 4 on October 29, 2014.[8] The first alpha version of Bootstrap 4 was released on August 19, 2015.[9] The first beta version was released on August 10, 2017.[10] Mark suspended work on Bootstrap 3 on September 6, 2016, to free up time to work on Bootstrap 4. Bootstrap 4 was finalized on January 18, 2018.[11]

Significant changes include:

Major rewrite of the code
Replacing Less with Sass
Addition of Reboot, a collection of element-specific CSS changes in a single file, based on Normalize
Dropping support for IE8, IE9, and iOS 6
CSS Flexible Box support
Adding navigation customization options
Adding responsive spacing and sizing utilities
Switching from the pixels unit in CSS to root ems
Increasing global font size from 14px to 16px for enhanced readability
Dropping the panel, thumbnail, pager, and well components
Dropping the Glyphicons icon font
Huge number[quantify] of utility classes
Improved form styling, buttons, drop-down menus, media objects and image classes
Bootstrap 4 supports the latest versions of Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari (except on Windows). It additionally supports back to IE10 and the latest Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR).[12]
